Stupeflix Tasks API Documentation
=================================

The REST API is the interface to access the Stupeflix tasks system.

The API is versioned. You should always use the newest version of the API, but
older versions will never be removed.

The base URL of the tasks system is ``https://dragon.stupeflix.com/``. So for
example the full URL for the method ``/foo/bar`` in the :doc:`v1/api` API is 
``https://dragon.stupeflix.com/v1/foo/bar``.
